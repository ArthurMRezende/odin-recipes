        <h1>Garlic Fried Chicken</h1>
        <p><a>This actually uses my breading for Chicken Fried Steak---my husband suggested we try it with chicken breasts, and it was delicious!</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.</li>   
        </ol>
